### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Start writing you own lyrics
+ This project is conducted by Chen Wang 

+ Project summary: The very much anticipated new song by Jay Chou hit 1.93 million views in 8 hours after it was released on Monday (September 16). The new song “Won’t Cry” quickly reached 300,000 views on YouTube in 30 minutes. Jay Chou is well known for composing all his new songs and some times even writing his own lyrics. So if you dream to become a famous singer like Jay who has fans all over the world, this post might help you with it. After reading this post, I am sure that you will be ready to pick up your pen and start with the lyrics. Try using the words we have discussed such as “love” and “baby” if aim for a positive sensing song and “fall” and “life” for the opposite. Try Pop music if you have a positive feeling for life and aim for metal music if you want to complain about the difficulties. Furthermore, always remember to learn from the successful artists and perhaps even travel to their hometown to find the feeling and idea for better lyrics.
